## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸš€ About Me

I am an undergraduate student passionate about systems-level programming. I have done a few internships and some personal projects mostly using C++, Rust and Python.

I'm currently advancing my language-specific knowledge in C++ and Rust, while also taking an interest in Haskell and functional programming in general.

I would enjoy collaborating on projects related to networking, protocol design, and other mid-level optimisation projects. Please feel free to reach out via `brian@brianc.me` :)

You can find my blog at [blog.brianc.me](https://blog.brianc.me). I enjoy writing about my projects, some details I observed about Rust and C++, and occasionally I write about my hobbies.
